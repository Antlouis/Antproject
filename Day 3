Morning:

Léon and Louis were in data analysis, while Amélie and Anne-Pia went to the ant room to check if things were going as planned.
They observed that the fire ants submitted to magnetic field had died, suposedly of dehydration, because they were not able to reach the cotton at the end of the tube.
We thus decided to not use the fire ants for the magnetic field experiment, and take only Messor sancta. We therefore started the messor replicate and got them used to the magnetic field.
The savanturiers also showed up with small children (aged 7) that came and visit us (they were the ones to bring up that the ants might be thirsty. 

We finished to create the captors repairing some of the mistake made during the assembling.


Afternoon

The team was quite divided throughout the afternoon because of team management meetings. We thus all alternated between 
finishing and checking the sensors, 
finishing the arduino code 
doing the first control experiment with the pheromones, 
feeding the ants in the tubes for the pheromone experiment
constructing the boxes for ant counting

And set up all our sensors to the same scale using the potentiometer.

We tried to start our first experiment to take data in during the night but we got caught up by the time scaddule that ptrevented us from finishing.

But we are almost ready to expriment at the first hour of the next day.
