Today is exclusively focused on analysing the data and prepare our presentation. 
On the morning we finish to plot our data and then start analysing it. 
We create graphs that show direction patterns in ants population.
We can then observe if our experiment has an effect on ants behaviour or not 
We observe on our graphs that the magnetic experiment has almost no effect compared to the pheromone experiment.

On the afternoon we prepare our presentation and share our workoad.
At 17h we start the presentation.
